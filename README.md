# Matrix-Rotation-derivation
This has a word document that shows how to derive matrix formulas for transformation.
**Things to go through**
1. Camera view point,
2. Projection Matrix
3. Orthogonal Matrix
**Project Requirements**
1. Weighing - 20%
  
3. Hand - write the derivation of the matrix (All of them)
4. Hand - write the projection Matrix derivation
