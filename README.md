# Matrix-Rotation-derivation
This has a word document that shows how to derive matrix formulas for transformation.
**Things to go through**
1. Camera view point,
2. Projection Matrix
3. Orthogonal Matrix


##Project Requirements
1. Weighing - 20%


   
##Look at these implementations
1. Scaling Matrix
2. Projection Matrix
3. Perspective Matrix

  
5. Hand - write the derivation of the matrix (All of them)
6. Hand - write the projection Matrix derivation
