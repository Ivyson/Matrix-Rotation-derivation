# Matrix Rotation Derivation

This document shows how to derive matrix formulas for transformations.

## Things to Go Through
1. Camera Viewpoint
2. Projection Matrix
3. Orthogonal Matrix

## Project Requirements
- Weighing: 20%

## Look at These Implementations
1. Scaling Matrix:
  
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
sx & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & sy & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & sz & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
3. World View Matrix
5. Perspective Matrix
6. Field of View
 
   

## Handwriting the Derivation of the Matrix
- All of them

## Handwriting the Projection Matrix Derivation

## Test Next Week
1. Use the gl_Matrix Library
2. Camera Matrix
3. Know how to go about Texture Mapping
