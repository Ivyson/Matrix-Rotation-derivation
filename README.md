# Matrix Rotation Derivation

This document shows how to derive matrix formulas for transformations.

## Things to Go Through
1. Camera Viewpoint
2. Projection Matrix
3. Orthogonal Matrix

## Project Requirements
- Weighing: 20%

## Look at These Implementations
1. Scaling Matrix:
   $$
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix}
   sx & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & sy & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & sz & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 1
   \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   $$
3. World View Matrix
4. Perspective Matrix
5. Field of View
 
   

## Handwriting the Derivation of the Matrix
