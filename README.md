# Matrix-Rotation-derivation
This has a word document that shows how to derive matrix formulas for transformation.
**Things to go through**
1. Camera view point,
2. Projection Matrix
3. Orthogonal Matrix


## Project Requirements
1. Weighing - 20%


   
## Look at these implementations
1. Scaling Matrix = `[ sx, 0, 0, 0,`
                      `0, sy, 0, 0,   `
                      `0, 0, sz, 0,`
                      `0, 0, 0, 1]`
3. World View Matrix
4. Perspective Matrix
5. Field of View

  
6. Hand - write the derivation of the matrix (All of them)
7. Hand - write the projection Matrix derivation


## Test next week
1. Use gl_Matrix Library
2. Camera Matrix
3. Know how to go about Texture mapping
